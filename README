On building the testcases:
When spliting audio into regions, use REAPER(http://www.reaper.fm/) to do the spliting, then use the "Batch file/item converter" built-in
to export the splitted regions. (keyboard shortcut - ctrl+shift+f) Note that don't use the "Render" function since it will not exactly export what's bounded by the regions.

We can use this to split a long piece of audio into short pieces, or split it into chord regions so as to build the
ground truths for chord recognition algorithms
